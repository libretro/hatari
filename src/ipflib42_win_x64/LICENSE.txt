The Software Preservation Society ("SPS")
Licence Agreement (Licence, Copyright and Terms of Use)

SPS technology is exclusively represented and licensed by
KryoFlux Products & Services Limited, 80 Allington Way, Maidstone,
ME16 0HN, United Kingdom


ATTENTION: READ CAREFULLY: By using, copying, or distributing the
accompanying software you indicate your acceptance of the following
SPS Licence Agreement ("Agreement").


PREAMBLE

The SPS philosophy dictates that the technology associated with allowing
floppy disk based software to be contained in a preservable form should be
provided to "the community" for free (free as in "free beer") to the
extent possible.


SPS technology can be divided into three major categories:

IPF SUPPORT LIBRARY: This piece of code, usually delivered in the form
of a dynamic link library, enables other products, e.g. emulators, to
read IPF files. These files contain preserved and authentic disk data.
The support library gives access to this data. The support library should
be accessible by anyone free of charge. Usage in a commercial environment
is permitted, although "use" explicitly does not include distribution or
sales of this technology. This means that commercial products can make use
of the library (be "enabled for use with"), but must ship without it. The
end user can download it for free and install it for usage with the
commercial product. Exclusions apply where a separate licensing agreement
has been established.

KRYOFLUX HIGH DEFINITION FLUX SAMPLER FOR USB: Preservation starts at
the ingestion level. SPS therefore has developed a combination of hard
and software targeted at software preservation called KryoFlux. KryoFlux
software may be used for private, non-commercial purposes only. KryoFlux
hardware schematics ar provided for private, non-commercial use as well.
Therefore private users can decide to build a KryoFlux board on their own,
as long as the board is used for private purposes only and as long as such
boards are not being sold to others (this includes boards given away for
any kind of compensation).

CTA SOFTWARE PRESERVATION ANALYSER: This product is the core of SPS
technology and is under constant development since 2001. The Analyser
is used by SPS internally and also available as a commercial product for
institutes, libraries, archives and museums. The Analyser is not free, it
is commercial software. This means that posession or distribution without
a proper licence is breach of international copyright treaties.


No profit whatsoever should be made as a result of this technology as a
whole with exception of the original copyright holders (in regard to
distribution of data stored in IPF files), SPS and its affiliates.

The SPS software, when speaking of "the library" or IPF files, should be
thought of as an "enabler", a form of distribution. It is just as a ZIP
file, just as an ADF file, just as your favourite writable CD ROM brand.
The data or content held by these files or media is entirely the
responsibility of you, the user. Ultimately, the SPS technology is just an
abstract digital recording medium.


This licence enforces this philosophy. It protects against misuse of
a technology that has been a long time in development and is provided
to the community or anyone else who would like to use it. It also
intends to protect SPS itself from possible legal liability.

You may notice that this licence is very strict in pursuit of getting
it into the hands of people who wish to use it for free. You cannot
charge to give it to somebody, not even for media costs. You cannot
have it on a CD ROM that is distributed for payment. You cannot use
it as part of providing a service that receives payment in any form.

Original copyright holders that wish to distribute their content with
the technology should contact SPS for a licence.

Any source provided (if any) is for inspection, understanding and
safe keeping only. This will ensure that data capture or stored with
SPS technology can still be accessed in the future even if there is
no successor or representative of SPS available. 

Infringement of any of the terms of this licence is breaching
international copyright laws, but it also hurts the communities
benefiting from the technology by risking its future improvement
and availability. 

This licence was not produced for the fun of it, you should note that
only those who could possibly financially or otherwise benefit from the
product are being restricted.

If you do not agree with any of the terms in this licence for the
Technology then you are obviously free to choose not to use it.

The latest version of this licence, libraries and imaging software can be
found on the follwing sites:

It is very easy to comply with this licence: Do not sell, modify or
abuse the software or images and don't steal code from source provided.
Learn, understand and write your own if you need to. Feel free to ask if
you want to use something you can not create on your own. That's it.
Everything else mentioned is here for those who may not understand these
very simple rules.


1. CLARIFICATION. The software product and accompanying documentation
   (the program's object code, source code and documentation are
   collectively referred to as the "Technology") is a technology and
   does not imply any restrictions, warranty, licence, obligation or
   any other link or association with what it may contain (the data
   encapsulated by the Technology is referred to as the "Content").
   
   Unless otherwise noted, The Software Preservation Society
   ("SPS") does not hold the copyright of the "Content", the data
   being reproduced, preserved, represented using the Technology. All
   copyright of Content provided using the Technology is held by its
   respective owners. Terms and conditions may apply to the Content
   that do not affect whatsoever the licence agreement provided with
   the Technology.

3. LIMITATIONS ON LICENCE. The licence granted in Section 2 is subject
   to the following restrictions:

   a. The Technology is to be used only for non-profit purposes unless
   you obtain prior written consent from SPS. Prohibited for-profit
   and commercial purposes include, but are not limited to:

     (i) Selling, licensing or renting the Technology to third parties
     for a fee (by payment of money or otherwise, whether direct or
     indirect);

     (ii) Using the Technology to provide services or products to others
     for which you are compensated in any manner (by payment of money
     or otherwise, whether direct or indirect), including, without
     limitation, providing support or maintenance for the Technology;

     (iii) Distribution or use from which any form of income is received
     regardless of profits therefrom, or from which any revenue or
     promotional value is received, as well as any distribution to or
     use in a corporate environment.  Use of the Technology to promote
     or support a commercial venture is included in this restriction;
     
     (iv) Using the Technology in a governmental and / or educational
	 institution or whole subsidiaries thereof;
     
     (v) Using the Technology to develop a similar application on any
     platform for commercial distribution, except to the extent this
	 restriction is prohibited by applicable law; or
     
     (vi) Using the Technology in any manner that is generally
     competitive with a SPS product as defined by SPS, except to the
	 extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable law.

   b. Media costs associated with the distribution of the Technology may
   not be recovered. You shall use your best efforts to promptly notify
   SPS upon learning of any violation of the above commercial
   restrictions.

   c. On each copy of the Technology you must conspicuously and
   appropriately reproduce this licence, copyright notice, and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact this Agreement and all notices
   that refer to this Agreement or any absence of warranty (whether
   written or interactively displayed); and give any other recipients
   of the Technology a copy of this Agreement.

   d. You may not modify, combine commercial applications with the
   Technology. You may not prepare derivative works of the Technology,
   except to the extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable law.
   Derivative works are defined as but not limited to:
   
     (i) Alternative support libraries. We are open to porting to other
     platforms, and so third parties doing such is unnecessary and
     violates the terms of this licence. If you want to port the
	 library, please contact us. We will host it on our site and ensure
	 that only the latest version is being distributed.
     
     (ii) Alternative tools that operate on files of the format as
     defined by the Technology. This includes but is not limited to:
     mastering tools (tools that enable Content to be written back to
     physical media like a floppy disk). Reproducing Content provided
     through or by the Technology to any other kind of media, such as
     alternative content provider technology (this also covers any kind
     of converter with the intention of extracting the Content to held
     by any other alternate media format that represents the same
     independently working Content). Additions, removals or other
     modification of data contained by the images.

   e. SPS, in its sole and absolute discretion, may have included
   a portion of the source code or online documentation of the
   Technology. Except for any such portions, you shall not REVERSE
   ENGINEER, DECOMPILE, DISASSEMBLE, OR OTHERWISE REDUCE ANY PORTION OF
   THE TECHNOLOGY TO ANY HUMAN PERCEIVABLE FORM, except to the extent
   this restriction is prohibited by applicable law.
   
   f. Commercial software (as defined in this section 3) may not
   contain any part of the Technology except for that part that is
   defined as the "access API" (the header files that allow interaction
   with the library itself, this is available separately from our site
   and has its own licence). This interface to the Technology "library"
   is provided is by us to enable the users of the commercial software
   to benefit from the Technology and still let the commercial software
   comply with this licence. In this way, the Technology itself need
   not (and should not) be distributed with a commercial product. The
   user should be advised that he can obtain this missing "plugin" from
   the SPS site and that it comes with its own licence that is not
   affected in any way by the licensc covering the commercial product.
   This otherwise does not effect the assertion that the Technology may
   not be used by commercial software as defined by this section 3.
   
   g. No distribution may include the totality or part of the
   Technology (including the Content encapsulated by the technology),
   changed, unchanged, encrypted, archived, in whatever form, unless
   according to the Licence or special agreement with SPS.
   
   h. Source code provided by SPS must not be redistributed.


4. DISTRIBUTION: As used in this Agreement, the term "distribute" (and
   its variants) includes making the Technology available (either
   intentionally or unintentionally) to third parties for copying or
   use, including providing timeshare access. Each time you distribute
   the Technology, the recipient must expressly agree to comply with
   these terms and conditions.  The recipient automatically receives
   this licence to use, copy, or distribute the Technology subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance with this
   Agreement by recipients.

    shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity without
    rendering invalid the remaining terms hereof. This Agreement shall
    be construed and enforced with the same force and effect as if
    entered into and performed in England and Wales and shall, in all
    respects, be interpreted in accordance with, and governed by the
    laws of this country.
	
    Anything else not covered by this agreement must be agreed with
    us before any action can be taken by any party.
